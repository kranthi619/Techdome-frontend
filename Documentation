# Techdome Frontend - CI/CD Workflow

This repository contains the source code for the Techdome Frontend application, along with a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow using GitHub Actions. The workflow is designed to automatically build, test, and deploy the React application to an AWS EC2 instance upon each push to the `main` branch.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

### 1. Build Stage:

- **Checkout Repository:** Fetches the latest code from the Techdome Frontend repository.
- **Set up Node.js:** Configures the Node.js environment for the project.
- **Install Dependencies:** Installs the required Node.js packages for the project.

### 2. Test Stage:

- **Checkout Repository:** Similar to the Build stage, fetches the latest code.
- **Set up Node.js:** Configures the Node.js environment.
- **Install Dependencies:** Installs project dependencies.
- **Run Tests:** Executes the defined tests to ensure the application's functionality and quality.

### 3. Deploy Stage:

- **Checkout Repository:** Fetches the latest code.
- **Set up SSH:** Configures SSH agent with private key for secure access to AWS EC2 instance.
- **Install Dependencies:** Installs project dependencies.
- **Build Application:** Generates a production-ready build of the React application.
- **Deploy to AWS EC2:** Transfers the build artifacts to the specified directory on the AWS EC2 instance.

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites:

1. **AWS Account:** Ensure you have an AWS account with an EC2 instance running Ubuntu.

2. **SSH Key Pair:** Generate an SSH key pair and add the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your EC2 instance.

3. **GitHub Repository Secrets:** Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for SSH access to your EC2 instance.
   - `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`: Content of the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file from your local machine.

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kranthi619/Techdome-frontend.git
   cd Techdome-frontend

2.Install Dependencies:
3.Run Tests:
4.Build Application:
5.Deploy to AWS EC2:

Ensure your EC2 instance is running.
Make sure you have added the correct SSH keys and known hosts to GitHub repository secrets.
Push changes to the main branch, and the CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy the application to your EC2 instance.
